# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. You will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.

## Case Study Overview

## Ask

-   **Goal**

Design Marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

-   **Business Task**

Identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

-   **Key Stakeholders**

    Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager.

    Cyclistic marketing analytics team: a team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.

    Cyclistic executive team.

-   **Data Sources**

Data collected from the first quarter of 2020 (Q1). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Prepare

-   Sorted the data to according to the started day and time.
-   Adjusted the column width to fit the content.

## Process

-   Created a column called "ride_length."
-   Created a column called "day_of_week."
-   Calculated the day of the week that each ride started using the "WEEKDAY" command (for example, =WEEKDAY(C2,1)) in each file. Format as General or as a number with no decimals, noting that 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday.

## Analyze

### Aggregation using R

Data aggregation is done in the R script. Here are the steps taken:

-   Collect data, create dataframes for the 7 months of data.
-   Inspected the data for aggregation.
-   Combine data into one table/dataframe.
-   Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year.
-   Convert "started_at" and "ended_at" to date-time objects to get the ride_length in seconds.
-   Aggregated the data to find key relationships and patterns.

### Key Insights

-   Members have more rides compared to casual members.

-   However, casual members spend more time on the bike compared to members.

## Share

I took my polished data to tableau public and got the following insights.

##### COUNT OF RIDE DATA AGAINST MONTHS

![rides vs months](rides%20vs%20months.jpg)

-   The number of rides increases drastically from March 2023 which is after winter, for both casual and members. Thus, bike riding is seasonal.

-   We can also see that members have more rides compared to casual members.

    ##### START-STATION NAME/COUNT RIDE-DATA

    ![station name vs number_of_rides](station%20name%20vs%20no%20of%20rides.jpg)

-   I also wanted to figure out the location that had most rides. According to the visualization, **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** had the most rides.

-   Casual riders often use the **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** as their start station.

##### RIDE-LENGTH / DAY OF WEEK

![duration vs day of week](duration%20vs%20day%20of%20week.jpg)

-   Casual riders spend more time on the bike compares to members.

-   Casual riders ride the most during the weekends and least on wednesday.

-   Member riders take the almost the same time riding daily.

##### RIDE TYPE VS COUNT OF RIDES

![ridetype vs count of rides](ridetype%20vs%20count%20or%20rides.jpg)

-   From this we can see that, member riders do not use the docked bike.

-   Member riders use the electric bike more than casual riders.

-   Member riders also use the classic bikes more then the casual riders.

##### RIDEABLE TYPE VS RIDE LENGTH

![ridetype vs ridelength](ridetype%20vs%20ridelength.jpg)

-   They both spend more time on the classic bikes but casual riders spend the most time.

##### NUMBER OF RIDES VS RIDEABLE TYPES

![number of rides vs rideable type](number%20of%20rides%20vs%20rideable%20type.jpg)

-   Electric bikes have been rode on the most.

-   The docked bikes have the least number of rides.\

## ACT

A lot of interesting insights were uncovered while analyzing the data for the case study. Casual and Member groups use Cyclistic service in different ways. Overall, the members use it more often but for a shorter periods of time.

Based on all of the above, here are my recommendations:

1.  The data clearly shows the seasonality of the service usage among casual riders, it will make sense to run promo campaigns during warmer months when the usage peaks. This way it is possible to cover more potential customers to convert to buy the membership.

2.  The marketing campaign would likely be more targeted at casual users if it is run on the weekends in the areas with the most used docking stations among the one-timers.Â  **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** docking station should be prioritized.

3.  We can increase the conversion of the casual customers if we promote and popularize the idea of 'green', eco-friendly and healthy transportation. Casual riders have more rides on the electric bike than any other.

#### Conclusion

Being my first analytics project, its has been insightful, challenging and interesting. It can always be improved and refined.
